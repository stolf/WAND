Etud - Ethernet Tunnel over UDP Daemon.

This is the Ethernet Over UDP part of WAND.  It's rather simple, it uses the
ethertap driver under linux.  (Make sure you have NetLink when you compiled
your kernel, and at least have ethertap as a module, also read
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ethertap.txt about how to create the
device nodes).

Ethertap over UDP assigns each node a unique number which becomes their
'hardware address'.  The driver keeps a list of MAC -> ip:port
addresses and sends the packet to the correct system.

Incoming packets are passed back up automatically.

Routing updates can be done by a simple protocol over a unix domain socket.
