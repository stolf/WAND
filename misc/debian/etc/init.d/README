  wand and Etud init scripts now work with the new HEAD code only.

  Etud runs 'ifup ${IFADDR}' and 'ifdown ${IFADDR}' at appropriate times.
  this assumes a few things:

  $IFADDR is set in the init script itself, to the interface of the Etud
  device (wan0 by default). 

  there is an entry in /etc/network/interfaces for wan0, looking similar
  to:

  noauto wan0
  iface wan0 inet static
      address 192.168.66.1
      netmask 255.255.0.0
      network 192.168.0.0
      broadcast 192.168.255.255
      mtu 1280
  

  This means you can just call 'ifdown wan0' or 'ifup wan0' and it configures
  the device for you. 

  This is all very debian specific for now. Redhat scripts to come. Talk
  to greig.
