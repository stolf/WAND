* wand desperately needs to use select, not sleep() :)
* Add make install
* Add a configuration file for Etud -- including where it's drivers are, or
  hard code the correct place that make install put 'em.
* have wand resolve FQDN.
* wand/wansd both need to have daemonize() (see Etud.cc for details on how)
* Etud should buffer and do one write for it's replies, instead of multiple.
