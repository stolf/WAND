* wand desperately needs to use select, not sleep() :)
* Add make install
* Add a configuration file for Etud -- including where it's drivers are, or
  hard code the correct place that make install put 'em.
* have wand resolve FQDN.
* wand/wansd both need to have daemonise() (see Etud.cc for details on how)
  .) should move daemonise() from Etud.cc someplace more global.
* Etud should buffer and do one write for it's replies, instead of multiple.

* client.cc send_request() needs work:
  .) parse replies better
  .) explain difference between "" and ''
* client.cc needs a converse() routine
* client.cc does not "pipeline" requests. Good Luck!
* Etud.cc does not support the "version" query.
