* Add make install
* Add a configuration file for Etud -- including where it's drivers are, or
  hard code the correct place that make install put 'em.
* have wand resolve FQDN.
* Etud should buffer and do one write for it's replies, instead of multiple.

* client.cc send_request() needs work:
  .) parse replies better
  .) explain difference between "" and ''
* client.cc needs a converse() routine
* client.cc does not "pipeline" requests. Good Luck!
* Etud.cc does not support the "version" query.
* Etud now ignores SIGPIPE while using write(2)
* Wand shouldn't close the socket prematurely.

* wand/wansd both now have daemonise and put_pid()
  .) This code is ugly and relies upon "../Ethernet-Over-UDP/src" too much.
     Bad Bad Bad.
